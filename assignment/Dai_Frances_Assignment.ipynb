    "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
    "\n",
    "    This paper is about data tidying and how it is an important step in data cleaning in making the later analysis as efficient and accurate as possible. He lays out a framework for datasets that are tidy and explains how keeping a consistent, maintained data structure is advantageous.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The tidy data standard attempts to make the data cleaning process (which takes up a lot of time in the entire data analysis process) easier by structuring datasets in a manageable way to facilitate better data analysis later on. It provides a standard way to organize data and make initial data cleaning easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    The first sentence means that while tidy datasets are organized in a standardized way and all similar in structure which makes them easy to navigate, messy datasets can have a breadth of different challenges associated with them and often all come with unique obstacles.\n",
    "    The second sentence means that while it may seem intuitive that variables are columns and rows are observations, it may be actually confusing when looking at individual data points/columns/rows to fully understand what metrics the data is defined by, despite understanding the idea of a data table. Sometimes the full understanding of variables and observations are not clear because there are many different levels of observation, confusing organization, unclear variable names etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Values are usually either numbers or strings.\n",
    "    Variables contain all values that measure the same attribute/property across units.\n",
    "    An observation is all values measured on the same unit across attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Tidy data is defined as a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. In tidy data, each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The five most common problems are:\n",
    "    1. Column headers are values, not variable names.\n",
    "    2. Multiple variables are stored in one column.\n",
    "    3. Variables are stored in both rows and columns.\n",
    "    4. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.\n",
    "    5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In Table 4, the data is messy because of the 1st common problem -- the columns are values of income instead of a variable name i.e. \"income\". Melting a database is turning the columns to rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Table 11 is messy because there is a column for every single day in the month (a value) instead of a variable name. Table 12 turns the days columns into a single data column. It is almost tidy, but instead of values, the element variable contains variable names (problem 3). It becomes tidy when you turn the element and value columns into separate tmax and tmin columns with their own values instead of variables in the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
    "  \n",
    "    The chicken-and-egg problem is if tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will be always linked to tidy data. There might come a point where changing tidy data or its tools does not result in any improvement. So, to always improve on data cleaning workflow, Wickham hopes that tidy data framework is one of many other data storage strategies and tools. "
